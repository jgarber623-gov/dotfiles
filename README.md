# jgarber623's Dotfiles
This is how I work.

## Installation

	git clone git://github.com/jgarber623/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
	cd ~/.dotfiles
	rake install

The installation rake task will configure symlinks in `~/` that point to the appropriate files in `~/.dotfiles`.

## Credit, Where Due
Most of this work is based on [Ryan Bates' dotfiles](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) project. The rest is picked up from various sources online, co-workers, friends, and others. Thanks, eveeryone!
